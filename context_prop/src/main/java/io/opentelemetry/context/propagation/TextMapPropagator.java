/**
 * Injects and extracts a value as text into carriers that travel in-band across process boundaries.
 * Encoding is expected to conform to the HTTP Header Field semantics. Values are often encoded as
 * RPC/HTTP request headers.
 *
 * <p>The carrier of propagated data on both the client (injector) and server (extractor) side is
 * usually an http request. Propagation is usually implemented via library- specific request
 * interceptors, where the client-side injects values and the server-side extracts them.
 *
 * <p>Specific concern values (traces, correlations, etc) will be read from the specified {@code
 * Context}, and resulting values will be stored in a new {@code Context} upon extraction. It is
 * recommended to use a single {@code Context.Key} to store the entire concern data:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public static final Context.Key CONCERN_KEY = Context.key("my-concern-key");
 * public MyConcernPropagator implements TextMapPropagator {
 *   public <C> void inject(Context context, C carrier, Setter<C> setter) {
 *     Object concern = CONCERN_KEY.get(context);
 *     // Use concern in the specified context to propagate data.
 *   }
 *   public <C> Context extract(Context context, C carrier, Getter<C> getter) {
 *     // Use getter to get the data from the carrier.
 *     return context.withValue(CONCERN_KEY, concern);
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
